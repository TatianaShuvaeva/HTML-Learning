    <h2>CHAPTER I. <br>
        Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>
    
    <p class="first">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”</p>

    <p id="second">So she was considering in her own mind (<s>as well as she could</s>, for the hot day made her feel very <u>sleepy and stupid</u>), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

    <p><strong>There was nothing</strong> so very <mark>remarkable</mark> in that; nor did Alice think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a <span class="marked">large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</span></p>
